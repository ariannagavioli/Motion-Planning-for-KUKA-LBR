Given a set of points the end effector must go through and an obstacle, the goal of the project is to implement a Motion Planning, performing null-space reconfiguration, using MATLAB and the CoppeliaSim simulator.
### Prerequisites and how to run it
In order to run the project, MATLAB 2020 and CoppeliaSim robot simulator must be installed.
Open the scene `vrep_model.ttt` defined in the `vrep_sim` sub-folder in the CoppeliaSim simulator and execute `main.m` from the MATLAB environment.
### Results 
Two possible motion controllers were used, one being a Cartesian Motion controller and the second being a Joint Motion controller. It's possible to configure which controller to use during the simulation by setting the `controller` variabe in `main.m` (line 17) either to `cartesian` or `joint`.
